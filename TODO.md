    - Backplot generation (pure js)
 * Unchecked pure js Machine interface (for browser things)
    - Lower priority
 * NodeJS module (refactor so same binding code can be used)
    - http://syskall.com/how-to-write-your-own-native-nodejs-extension/index.html/
    - Portability of scripts has to be considered. It is desired that scripts be self-contained so they can easily be regenerated on different systems.
